## ‚ú® Key Architectural & Technical Highlights

This project is more than a simple e-commerce application; it's a production-grade boilerplate engineered for scalability, performance, and maintainability, aligning with modern FAANG-level standards.

### Architecture & Design Patterns

-   **Scalable Monorepo:** Organized as a monorepo using `npm workspaces`, containing separate `client`, `server`, and `shared` packages for clean separation of concerns and streamlined development.
-   **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Pattern:** The Express.js server acts as a BFF, decoupling the client from external data sources. This enhances security by hiding API keys, improves performance via server-side caching, and simplifies client-side data fetching.
-   **Clean, Layered Backend:** The server follows a clean architecture with distinct layers for controllers and services, promoting separation of concerns and testability.
-   **End-to-End Type Safety:** A dedicated `shared` package provides TypeScript types and data transformation logic used by both the client and server, ensuring robust type safety across the entire stack and eliminating API contract mismatches.
-   **SOLID & DRY Principles:** The architecture adheres to principles like Single Responsibility (e.g., `useProducts` hook, `cache.service.ts`) and Don't Repeat Yourself (e.g., the `shared` package).

### Performance & Scalability

-   **Built for Large Datasets:** The application is designed to handle millions of products efficiently.
    -   **API Pagination:** The backend API is paginated to deliver data in manageable chunks.
    -   **List Virtualization:** The frontend uses `@tanstack/react-virtual` to render only the visible items in a list, ensuring smooth scrolling and low memory usage even with massive datasets.
-   **Advanced Caching:**
    -   **Server-Side Caching:** An in-memory LRU cache (`lru-cache`) is implemented on the server to minimize latency and reduce load on external APIs.
    -   **Client-Side Caching:** TanStack Query provides sophisticated client-side caching, request deduplication, and background refetching out of the box.
-   **Optimized Data Fetching:** Implements a resilient `fetchWithRetry` mechanism on both client and server to handle transient network errors gracefully.
-   **Ready for Modern Deployment:** The decoupled architecture is primed for advanced deployment strategies like Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) to optimize SEO and initial load times.

### React & TypeScript Best Practices

-   **Modern React:** Employs the latest React features and best practices.
    -   **Custom Hooks:** Business logic is cleanly abstracted into reusable hooks (e.g., `useProducts`).
    -   **Context Abstraction:** UI state is managed via a clean Context API (`ProductProvider`), avoiding prop-drilling.
    -   **Intelligent State Management:** Correctly distinguishes between server state (managed by **TanStack Query**) and global UI state (managed by **React Context**), which is a hallmark of modern, high-performance React applications.
-   **Effective TypeScript:** Leverages TypeScript to its full potential, not just for basic type definitions but for creating a strongly-typed, maintainable, and less error-prone codebase.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This project is a monorepo containing two main packages:

-   `client/`: A React application built with Vite.
-   `server/`: An Express.js server.
-   `shared/`: Contains shared types and utilities between the client and server.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
-   npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/WEB-DEVELOPER-ENGINEER/REM-Waste.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd REM-Waste
    ```

3.  Install dependencies from the root directory. This will install dependencies for both the `client` and `server`.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

You can run both the client and server concurrently with a single command from the root directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- The React development server on `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).
- The Express backend server on `http://localhost:5000` (or as configured in `server/.env`).
